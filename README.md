# BubbleSortAnyNum
   
   I tried to find a way to sort an Array of integers. First, I tried to manually input each variable through 
   
   <p>
   <p> int a = input.nextInt();
   <n>int b = input.nextInt();</n>
   int c = input.nextInt();
   int d = input.nextInt(); </p>
   
   and so forth. I found it very inefficient and not hard-coded. Thus, I decided to insert a basic for loop so that any number that gets inputted automatically gets aded to an array of n integers.  Then, I swapped the element arr1[j-1] with arr1[j] if it was greater, and I kept on doing it until the nested for loop on line 30 reached the end of the array. I tried the program with all sorts of huge integers, and this BubbleSort program works for any integer 2,147,483,647 or under. Thanks for reading my code!
